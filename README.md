# daytime

Welcome to `daytime`, a package for working with daytimes in physical behavior
research, with an eventual goal of making it easy to calculate circular averages
and standard deviations. Maybe we'll even plot something. I have no idea what
I'm doing yet, so contributions are welcome. You're also welcome to just laugh
at my attempts. Cheers!
