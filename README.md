# daytime

Welcome to `daytime`, a package for working with daytimes in physical behavior
research. A key goal of `daytime` is making it easy to calculate descriptive
metrics (see the [vignette](https://paulhibbing.com/daytime)). Feel free to provide
feedback in an [issue](https://github.com/paulhibbing/daytime/issues) or
contribute via [pull request](https://github.com/paulhibbing/daytime/pulls) --
happy coding!
