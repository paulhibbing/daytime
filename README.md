# daytime

Welcome to `daytime`, a package for working with daytimes in physical behavior
research. A key goal of `daytime` is making it easy to calculate circular averages
and standard deviations. Those methods are included in the current package version,
although I am still not sure whether the standard deviation method returns the
expected units. Feel free to provide feedback in an [issue](https://github.com/paulhibbing/daytime/issues)
or contribute via [pull request](https://github.com/paulhibbing/daytime/pulls) -- happy coding!
